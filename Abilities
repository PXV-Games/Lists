An Ability will be automatically trained depending on the action and the duration of it.

If the action is based directly on the Ability, for example, leaning to drive. The Ability Driving will gain experience on a 100% rate.
If an Ability is left unused for a large period of time it will begin to decay over time.
An Ability can be trained as secondary to some actions, for example, cooking. The Ability won't be trained becouse the purpouse of the action is not to train the Ability, but to cook.

The experience earned will be counted on Exp. points, all of them will be accumulated and reach a new level.

The needs will have a direct effect on the obtention of Exp. points, if the player is tired, unhealthy, or hungry, won't learn as fast as if it is energized or feels well.
Some perks like "Joker" or "Childish" come with already obtained Abilities, that will begin at certain levels, and will never go down.
Some Abilities will only be able to be trained or obtained only if the player has already some experience in a more basic Ability. For example, Accounting won't be possible if Math isn't good enough.
Some Abilities will help to train others, if the player has a certain level of Academics will be able to train faster on Math, Chemistry or Biology
