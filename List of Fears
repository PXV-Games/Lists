Fears will predict the behaviour of the PC once it finds himself in certain situations. 
If the PC or NPC finds himself in a situation that fears, his levels of stress will inmediatly increase until it suffers a breakdown.
The possibilities to evade a breakdown are running away from the situation, not accepting the orders of the player or falling to the floor and cry/scream.

The different reactions to a psychological trauma are:
  feeling as if you are in a state of ‘high alert’ and are ‘on watch’ for anything else that might happen
  feeling emotionally numb, as if in a state of ‘shock’
  becoming emotional and upset
  feeling extremely fatigued and tired
  feeling very stressed and/or anxious
  being very protective of others including family and friends
  not wanting to leave a particular place for fear of ‘what might happen’.
  
This will happen randomly after a traumatic situation and depending on the situation, they will create a temporal thought that will be erased after a determined time (longer than normal thoughts)
There will be certain solutions and ways to reduce the effect or time of a temporal thought
